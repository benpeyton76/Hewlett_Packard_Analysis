## ***Overview:***

In the Module 7 Challenge, we are asked to find the number of employees retiring from Pelwett Hackard. The manager wants to know the retiring employees by title, and also find the employees who fall within certain age criteria to participate in a mentorship program before they retire. Our manager asked that a report be written that summarizes the data analysis and helps the manager prepare for the "silver tsunami" due to the large amount of employees retiring soon.

## ***Results:***

* A high number of employees will be eligible for retirement at any time as shown by the retirement_titles table. 
* The importance of starting a mentor program will be essential in order for Pewlett Hackard to continue workflow with minimal interuption due to staffing issues.
* Due to the amount of employees that could retire at any time, the mentoring program should be implemented quickly.
* Most of the retirement eligible employees carry senior titles.
